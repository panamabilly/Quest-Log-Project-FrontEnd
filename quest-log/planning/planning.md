### Your project idea: Quest-Log

My idea is to create a app, where you can login and pin locations and add information and pictures of places you have been around the world. If time allows I would like to expand it to show the ski resorts in the Rocky Mountains.

### Your tech stack (frontend, backend, database)

ReactJS, MongoDB or Django
Will start the project using MongoDB if I canâ€™t figure out user authorization and photo upload in MongoDB I will switch to Django.

### User stories (MVP)

As a user, I want to be able to pin locations that I have visited.

As a user, I want to be able to add information into a form about the place that I have visited and save the information to a backend server.

### Stretch Goals

As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so that I can save my own pins on the map.

As a user, I want to be able to upload photos to the database.

As a user, I want to be able to see a gallery of the photos I have uploaded.

As a user I want to be able to see the ski resorts in the Rocky Mountains on the map as pins with the Name, State, Description, Website and Photo.

### Anything else your squad lead should know

I am planning to learn how to use Mapbox and Mapbox GL for this project.
